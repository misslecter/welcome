Vyšehrad Castle is one of Prague's hidden gems, offering a peaceful retreat from the more crowded tourist spots. Located
just a short walk from the apartment, this historic fortress provides stunning panoramic views of the Vltava River and
the city skyline.

Vyšehrad is steeped in legend, often referred to as the mythical birthplace of Prague. The castle grounds are perfect
for a leisurely stroll, featuring beautiful gardens, impressive medieval walls, and the striking Basilica of St. Peter
and St. Paul.

One of the highlights is the Vyšehrad Cemetery, the final resting place of many famous Czech figures, including
composers like Antonín Dvořák and Bedřich Smetana. For history lovers, the castle’s Romanesque rotunda, one of the
oldest buildings in Prague, is a must-see.

Whether you're interested in history, architecture, or just want to relax in a serene park setting, Vyšehrad is an
excellent spot to explore during your stay. Plus, it’s usually quieter than other major landmarks, making it ideal for a
more intimate experience of Prague's rich history.
